function scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,meanL,varargin)
% Scale scene luminance
%
%   scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,param,val)
%
% The photon level in the scene structure is multiplied so that the
% luminance parameter ('mean' or 'peak') is set to val. The illuminant is
% also scaled to preserve the reflectance.
%
% scene:  Scene object
% param:  Which param, choices are 'mean' or 'peak'
% val:    Luminance value at of the param on return
% 
%Example:
%   scene = sceneCreate; sceneGet(scene,'mean luminance')
%   scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,'mean',10);  % Set to 10 cd/m2.
%   sceneGet(scene,'mean luminance')
%
%   scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,'peak',200);
%   sceneGet(scene,'mean luminance')
%
% For backwards compatibility, we still allow setting the mean level as
%
%   scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,100);
%   sceneGet(scene,'mean luminance')
%
% But this is not preferred.
