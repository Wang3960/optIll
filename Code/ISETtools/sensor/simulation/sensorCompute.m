function outSensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi,showBar)
%Compute sensor response from optical image data
%
%   sensor = sensorCompute([sensor],[oi],[showBar = 1])
%
%  This function calculates the sensor volts (electrons) at each pixel from
%  the optical image (oi).
%
% Inputs
%    sensor:   Image sensor, possibly a cell array of sensors
%    oi:       Optical irradiance data
%
% Return
%    sensor: Image sensor (possibly an array of sensors). The computed
%    voltage data are stored in the sensor.
%
%  The computation checks a variety of parameters and flags in the sensor
%  structure to perform the calculation.  These parameters and flags can be
%  set either through the graphical user interface (sensorImageWindow) or
%  by scripts.
%
% NOISE FLAG
%  The noise flag is an important way to control the details of the
%  calculation.  The default value of the noiseFlag is 2.  In this case,
%  which is standard operating, photon noise, read/reset, FPN, analog
%  gain/offset, clipping, quantization, are all included.  Different
%  selections are made by different values of the noiseFlag.  
%
%   sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise flag',noiseFlag);   
%
% The conditions are:
%
%  noiseFlag | photon other-noises analog-gain/offset clipping quantization
%    -1      |   0         0            0                0        0
%     0      |   0         0            +                +        +
%     1      |   +         0            +                +        +
%     2      |   +         +            +                +        +
%
% Further control can be achieved by setting parameters
%   To remove analog-gain/offset, set the parameters to 1,0
%   To remove quantization, set 'quantization method' to 'analog'
%   These are both the default conditions. 
%
% COMPUTATIONAL OUTLINE:
%
%   This is an overview of the algorithms.  The specific algorithms are
%   described in the routines themselves.
%
%   1. Handle exposure: autoExposure (or not).
%   2. Compute the mean image: sensorComputeImage()
%   3. Etendue calculation
%   4. Noise, analog gain, clipping, quantization
%   5. Correlated double-sampling
%   6. Handle macbeth management
%
%  The value of showBar determines whether the waitbar is displayed to
%  indicate progress during the computation.
%
% See also:  sensorComputeNoise, sensorAddNoise
%
% Examples:
%   sensor = sensorCompute;   % Use selected sensor and oi
%   tmp = sensorCompute(vcGetObject('sensor'),vcGetObject('oi'),0);
%
%  Or, compute with specific sensors
%   scene = sceneCreate; scene = sceneSet(scene,'hfov',4);
%   oi = oiCreate; sensor = sensorCreate;
%   oi = oiCompute(oi,scene); sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
%   vcAddAndSelectObject(sensor); sensorWindow('scale',1);
